# OTP-based-cardless-transaction
This project aims to develop an OTP Based Cardless Transaction System that allows users to withdraw cash from an ATM without the need for a physical debit or credit card.
A secure, user-friendly cardless transaction system that enhances customer satisfaction and reduces the risk associated with using physical cards for transactions.
These security concerns include the risk of card cloning, skimming, and theft.
